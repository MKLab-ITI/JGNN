# Tutorials

Here we provide tutorials that demonstrate usage of JGNN in domain-specific tasks.
We do not delve into inner workings of the library,
as these are mainly covered in the [Guidebook](https://mklab-iti.github.io/JGNN/).
Below we summarize available material.

Some simulated trajectory measurements are obtained across time steps
that are organized into line graphs. There are two types of trajectories:
those with full data, and those for which parts of trajectory data are missing.
The goal is to differentiate between the two types.
