# JGNN 

[![Latest nightly release](https://jitpack.io/v/MKLab-ITI/JGNN.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#MKLab-ITI/JGNN) [![Latest stable release](https://img.shields.io/badge/JAR-1.2.0%20stable-red)](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/JGNN/releases/latest) 

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are getting more and more popular, for example to
make predictions based on relational information, or to perform inference
on small datasets. JGNN provides native Java implementations of this machine
learning paradigm, and does not require dedicated hardware or firmware.
Follow the Jitpack badge for Gradle or Maven integration.

* Cross-platform
* Lightweight
* Optimized: data views, automatic datatypes, SIMD, parallelized batching
* Neuralang scripting language for model definition

Feel free to contribute in any way, for example through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/JGNN/issues). In addition to bug reports, 
requests for features and clarifications are welcome.
