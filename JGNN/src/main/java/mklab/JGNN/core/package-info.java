/**
 * Contains base numerical data classes, as well as supporting abstract classes.
 * Provided classes are endowed with binary, unary, and in-place editing
 * operations. Sub-packages are responsible for implementing variations, for
 * example organize data in sparse, dense, or SIMD dense tensors, or provide
 * views to segments of larger structures. This package and its sub-packages can
 * be used as a standalone product for vector/tensor and matrix operations using
 * only native Java.
